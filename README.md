# [Emmet](http://emmet.io) &lt;textarea&gt; plugin for Drupal 7

This is simple Drupal 7 module that embeds the [Emmet TextArea](https://github.com/emmetio/textarea) js into a Drupal theme for development purposes. When installed, this module allows Emmet code to be processed in TextArea fields on both Public and Admin themes.
  
 All credit for anything Emmet related goes to the people at [Emmet](http://emmet.io). I am in no way associated or affiliated with the Emmet Project.

**This is definitely for development usage only.**
